This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Portfolio

A modern, responsive personal portfolio built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS v4.

Features
- Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact sections
- Sticky Navbar and Footer
- Contact form wired to `/api/contact` (console logs by default)
- Theme via CSS variables for easy color tweaks

Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

Customize
- Update copy in the components under `app/sections` and `app/components`.
- Replace images in `public/` and update links, social profiles in `Footer.jsx`.
- Hook contact form to a real service inside `app/api/contact/route.js`.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
